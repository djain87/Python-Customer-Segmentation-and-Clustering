# Python-Customer-Segmentation-and-Clustering
Data analysis portfolio project that will allow you to perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers using variables such as income, age, and shopping score. The goal is to predict the ideal number of customer groups based on these factors.
# The Approach
Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data and the distribution of each variable. Additionally, exploring correlations between variables will be done through techniques like scatter plots or correlation matrices. 
The k-means clustering algorithm will then be applied to identify the optimal number of clusters, supported by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate.
After identifying the clusters, summary statistics such as mean, median, and count will be calculated for each cluster to describe the key features of each group. Based on these summary statistics and analyses, the ideal marketing group will be identified. 
Visualizations will be created to present the findings, and actionable recommendations for tailored marketing strategies will be provided for each customer segment.

PowerPoint
# Analysis

The target group for marketing efforts is identified as Cluster 1, characterized by a high spending score and high income.
Cluster 4 represents a compelling opportunity to market sales events, especially focusing on popular items, given its customer base with low annual income but a high spending score. 
60 percent of Cluster 1 shoppers are women. To attract these customers, a targeted marketing campaign emphasizing popular items within this cluster would be effective.
